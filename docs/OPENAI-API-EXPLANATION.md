# 🤖 Why Do You Need the OpenAI API Key?

## 🎯 Quick Answer

Your **n8n workflow uses OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model** to:
1. **Generate recipes** from ingredients and dietary preferences
2. **Provide cooking assistance** and answer cooking questions
3. **Create intelligent responses** for the chat assistant

Without the OpenAI API key, these AI features won't work!

## 🔍 How OpenAI is Used in Your Workflow

### **1. Recipe Generation**
When you input ingredients like "chicken, pasta, tomato sauce", your workflow:

1. **Sends a prompt to OpenAI**:
   ```
   Create a delicious recipe using: chicken breast (2 pieces), pasta (200g), tomato sauce (1 cup). 
   Dietary preferences: gluten-free.
   
   Provide in this JSON format:
   {
     "name": "Recipe Name",
     "ingredients": [...],
     "instructions": [...],
     "dietaryPreference": [...],
     "additionalInformation": {...}
   }
   ```

2. **OpenAI responds** with a complete recipe:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Gluten-Free Chicken Pasta",
     "ingredients": [
       {"name": "Chicken breast", "quantity": "2 pieces"},
       {"name": "Gluten-free pasta", "quantity": "200g"},
       {"name": "Tomato sauce", "quantity": "1 cup"}
     ],
     "instructions": [
       "Cook gluten-free pasta according to package instructions",
       "Season chicken with salt and pepper",
       "Grill chicken until cooked through",
       "Combine pasta with tomato sauce and sliced chicken"
     ],
     "dietaryPreference": ["gluten-free"],
     "additionalInformation": {
       "tips": "Use gluten-free pasta for dietary restrictions",
       "variations": "Try with different sauces",
       "servingSuggestions": "Serve hot with fresh herbs",
       "nutritionalInformation": "High protein, moderate carbs"
     }
   }
   ```

### **2. Chat Assistant**
When you ask cooking questions like "How can I make this recipe vegetarian?", your workflow:

1. **Sends a context-aware prompt to OpenAI**:
   ```
   You are a cooking assistant for: Chicken Pasta
   
   Recipe: Chicken breast (2 pieces), Pasta (200g), Tomato sauce (1 cup)
   Instructions: Cook pasta, grill chicken, combine ingredients
   
   Help with: substitutions, techniques, modifications, serving, nutrition, variations, tips.
   Keep responses focused and helpful.
   
   User question: How can I make this recipe vegetarian?
   ```

2. **OpenAI responds** with helpful advice:
   ```
   To make this recipe vegetarian, you can substitute the chicken breast with:
   
   1. **Tofu** - Use firm tofu, marinate in soy sauce and grill
   2. **Chickpeas** - Add 1 can of chickpeas for protein
   3. **Mushrooms** - Use portobello mushrooms as a meat substitute
   4. **Lentils** - Add cooked lentils for protein and texture
   
   The pasta and tomato sauce are already vegetarian-friendly!
   ```

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **In Your n8n Workflow**

Your workflow has **2 OpenAI nodes**:

1. **"OpenAI Chat Model"** (for chat assistant)
   - Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Handles cooking questions and advice

2. **"OpenAI Chat Model1"** (for recipe generation)
   - Model: `gpt-4o-mini`
   - Creates recipes from ingredients

### **In Your Frontend**

Your Next.js app calls these n8n webhooks:
- **Recipe Generation**: `/api/generate-recipes` → n8n → OpenAI
- **Chat Assistant**: `/api/chat-assistant` → n8n → OpenAI

## 💰 Cost and Free Tier

### **OpenAI Free Tier**
- **$5 credit** when you sign up
- **GPT-4o-mini** is very affordable (~$0.15 per 1M tokens)
- **Your workflow is optimized** for minimal token usage

### **Estimated Costs**
- **Recipe generation**: ~500-1000 tokens per recipe
- **Chat response**: ~200-500 tokens per question
- **$5 credit** = ~33,000-100,000 requests (depending on complexity)

### **Cost Optimization**
Your workflow is designed to be **free-tier friendly**:
- Uses `gpt-4o-mini` (cheaper than GPT-4)
- Optimized prompts to minimize token usage
- Efficient JSON formatting to reduce response size
