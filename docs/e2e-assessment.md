# End-to-End Testing Assessment

### ✅ Summary of Current Coverage

The `smart-recipe-generator` project previously included E2E tests covering critical user paths:

#### Currently Covered Flows:

* ✅ **Guest landing page UI** (`landing.cy.ts`)
* ✅ **Login flow and protected route access** (`login.cy.ts`)
* ✅ **Recipe creation process**, including:

  * Ingredient selection
  * Dietary preference selection
  * Recipe generation
  * Recipe save logic (`createRecipe.cy.ts`)
* ✅ **Recipe card actions** (`recipeCardActions.cy.ts`)

  * Open Recipe (🟢 pushed in prior commit)
  * Copy Link
  * Chat with Assistant
  * Clone Ingredients
  * Play Audio
  * Delete Recipe
* ✅ **Home page infinite scroll** loads additional recipes when scrolling to the bottom (`infiniteScroll.cy.ts`)
* ✅ **Search and filtering** via search bar and tags (`searchFiltering.cy.ts`)
* ✅ **Sorting recipes** by newest or most popular (`sortRecipes.cy.ts`)

Each of these flows is mock-driven and uses `cy.intercept()` and custom commands like `mockSession`, `mockGetRecipes`, and `mockGetNotifications` to simulate backend behavior.

### ⚠️ Gaps in Test Coverage

The current tests verify core recipe interactions but **miss several other important features** advertised in the app’s README and observed in the codebase:

| Feature                       | E2E Status   | Notes                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search / Filtering**        | ✅ Covered    | Verified search and tag filtering (`searchFiltering.cy.ts`)                |
| **Sorting Recipes**           | ✅ Covered    | Verified sorting by newest and popular (`sortRecipes.cy.ts`)               |
| **Infinite Scrolling**        | ✅ Covered    | Verified loading additional recipes when scrolling (`infiniteScroll.cy.ts`) |
| **Liking / Unliking Recipes** | ❌ Not tested | Implemented in backend and UI (`/RecipeDetail`, `/Home`)                   |
| **Notifications Page**        | ❌ Not tested | No E2E for reading notifications, marking as read, or navigating from them |
| **Chat Assistant Messages**   | ❌ Not tested | Only navigation is tested—no E2E covering actual chat interaction          |
| **API Error / Limit Cases**   | ❌ Not tested | Edge cases like auth failure, OpenAI limit reached, or empty states        |

---

### 🧩 Fragility and Test Design

* **DOM Selector Fragility**: Current tests use `cy.get('button[id^="headlessui-popover-button"]')`, which is susceptible to breakage from UI library updates. **Recommendation**: use `data-testid` attributes for resilience.
* **Next.js Route Intercepts**: Tests that intercept `_next/data/.../CreateRecipe.json` may break with framework upgrades. **Recommendation**: prefer API intercepts over internal Next.js fetches.

---

### 🧪 CI & Runtime Notes

* ✅ Tests are mock-heavy, which is good for determinism
* ❌ E2E testing has been removed from the project.

  * **Status**: No E2E testing framework is currently configured.

---

### 🟢 Suggested Next Steps

1. **Cover Feature Gaps**:

   * Search + tag filters
   * Liking / unliking from card and detail page
   * Notifications: unread indicator, routing, and marking as read
   * Full AI chat interaction

2. **Edge Case Handling**:

   * API error fallbacks (e.g., 500, 403)
   * Unauthenticated redirects
   * Usage limit messages (AI token limits)

3. **Improve Selectors**:

   * Add `data-testid` attributes to all action-triggering UI elements

4. **Enable CI Execution**:

   * No E2E testing framework is currently configured

### 📌 Conclusion

Your current E2E tests show solid coverage for **recipe creation** and **core card interactions**, which are arguably the app’s most important features. However, major app behaviors (searching, notifications, likes, full chat flow) remain **untested**, representing both potential regressions and missed confidence during development.

Expanding coverage into these areas and hardening test resilience would yield a much stronger assurance baseline.
